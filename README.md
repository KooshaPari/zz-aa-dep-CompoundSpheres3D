# Compound-Spheres-3D (Canonical)

Canonical home of the WSM3D-extended fork of [MelvinShwuaner/Compound-Spheres](https://github.com/MelvinShwuaner/Compound-Spheres).
This repository is the 3-way merge of three sources:

| Source | Role | Branch / SHA |
|---|---|---|
| `MelvinShwuaner/Compound-Spheres` | original Unity tool | `main` @ `a642e27` |
| `KooshaPari/Compound-Spheres-3D` (live) | WSM3D fork with `FrustumCuller`, `HeightFieldRenderer`, `IGridDimensions` and CI workflows | `wsm3d/main` @ `e1953bb` |
| `KooshaPari/Compound-Spheres-3D-Backup` | evolved superset (perf + sota GPU compute merged into `wsm3d/main`) | `wsm3d/main` @ `86f75d0` |

The merge was authored on 2026-08-10 by `forge@kooshapari.local` as Decision 1 of the absorption run.
The previous split into a separate `live` and `backup` repo is **collapsed**: the live fork was deleted
and its bare clone is preserved only as a local remote for diffing.

## What was merged

### From upstream (MelvinShwuaner/Compound-Spheres) → kept as `upstream/`
- `CompoundMeshes/` — the upstream migration (MeshManager, BufferBase, DynamicHandler,
  StaticHandler, native-array buffer). Live/backup never picked this up because they
  are post-`WorldSphereMod` lineage and pinned to `CompoundSpheres/`. Preserved as a
  reference, **not** built into `CompoundSpheres.sln`.
- `CompoundMeshes.sln` — upstream's solution file (preserved alongside for the same reason).
- `upstream/README.upstream.md` — upstream's own README frozen.

### From live (KooshaPari/Compound-Spheres-3D wsm3d/main) → selective
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — pre-commit hooks (live-only, no equivalent in backup or upstream)
- `.trunk/trunk.yaml` — trunk linter config (live-only)
- `.github/stale.yml` — stale-issue rot policy (live-only)
- The rest of live's tree is now covered by backup; live's `intake/backup-content-into-live-20260810`
  branch's "semantic merge" decisions were inspected and re-evaluated here.

### From backup (KooshaPari/Compound-Spheres-3D-Backup wsm3d/main) → adopted as the base
- All `perf/incremental-heightfield` and `sota/gpu-compute-golive` merges (the "evolved superset")
- `CompoundSpheres/Gpu/GpuShapeMath.cs` (3-shape cylindrical/flat/cube math)
- `CompoundSpheres/IGridDimensions.cs` (port that SphereManager + GpuSphereManager implement)
- `Tests/CompoundSpheres.Tests/` (4 files: csproj + 3 test files — 19 parity tests)
- `fix(grid): wire IGridDimensions incremental-heightfield members` (75c7f96)
- `fix(render): enable _ALPHABLEND_ON keyword + renderQueue=3000 + SetOverrideTag in ConfigureWater` (5daf5da)
- `backup: README explaining Compound-Spheres-3D recovery context` (535bf49) — replaced by this README
- All CI files (org template versions, 2026-08-05)

## What was hybridized

Per the **"best of each, hybridize where logical, long-term low-cost-of-change"** rule:

| File | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `CompoundSpheres/HeightFieldRenderer.cs` | **Backup's version** (was stranded in the 2026-08-10 intake PR) | Backup uses `IGridDimensions _manager` (interface) instead of `SphereManager _manager` (concrete). Long-term low-cost-of-change: the interface lets the renderer swap implementations (CPU vs GPU actor/voxel). Also keeps the `ConfigureWater` fix with `_ALPHABLEND_ON` keyword + `renderQueue=3000` + `SetOverrideTag`. |
| `CompoundSpheres/SphereManager.cs` | **Backup's version** | Backup adds `IGridDimensions` to the class and the `SnapshotDirtyHeights()` method needed for incremental heightfield rebuilds. |
| `CompoundSpheres/FrustumCuller.cs` | **Backup's version** | Backup uses `GpuDefaults.TileWorldPosition(manager, ...)` (shape-aware) instead of `CartesianToCylindrical` (cylindrical-only). Long-term low-cost-of-change: future cube/flat shape support works without rewriting the culler. |
| `CompoundSpheres/Gpu/GpuManagerBase.cs` | **Backup's version** | Backup wires the `Shape` selector + `ZDisplacement`/`ConstRot` uniforms + `_cubeRegionBuffer` for the 3-shape go-live kernel. |
| `CompoundSpheres/Gpu/GpuSphereManager.cs` | **Backup's version** | Backup implements `IGridDimensions` and exposes `UseCubeShape(GpuCubeRegion[], float)`. |
| `CompoundSpheres/BufferUtils.cs` | **Backup's version** (kept as-is) | Backup's `BufferUtils.cs` is byte-identical to upstream's `CompoundSpheres/BufferUtils.cs`; upstream's NEW work is in `upstream/CompoundMeshes/BufferUtils.cs` (493 lines, completely different architecture). |
| `CompoundSpheres/SphereManagerSettings.cs` | **Backup's version** (kept as-is) | Same as live — byte-identical. |
| `CompoundSpheres/SphereRow.cs` | **Backup's version** (kept as-is) | Same as live — byte-identical. |
| `CompoundSpheres/CompoundSpheres.csproj` | **Backup's version** (kept as-is) | Same as live — byte-identical. |
| `Default Assets/CompoundSphereCompute.compute` | **Backup's version** | The 3-shape parity go-live kernel (the live's version was the pre-go-live variant). |
| `README.md` | **NEW** (this file) | Combines live's AI-DD-META header + divergence matrix with backup's 3-way merge provenance + verification status. |
| `CompoundSpheres.sln` | **Backup's version** | References `CompoundSpheres\CompoundSpheres.csproj` (the WSM3D fork). Upstream's `CompoundMeshes.sln` is kept at `upstream/CompoundMeshes.sln`. |
| CI files (`.circleci/`, `.github/workflows/`, etc.) | **Backup's "org template" versions** (Aug 5) | Newer than live's stable lint/test gate names (Aug 2). Plus live's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.trunk/trunk.yaml`, `.github/stale.yml` on top. |
| `.gitignore` | **Backup's version** | Cleaner than live's. |
| `.mergify.yml`, `renovate.json`, `trunk.yaml` | **Backup's version** | Identical to live; backup is newer. |

## Verifying the merge

After cloning:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KooshaPari/Compound-Spheres-3D.git
cd Compound-Spheres-3D

# Confirm provenance
git log --oneline -1   # canonical initial commit
git log --oneline 86f75d0  # backup's tip (now an ancestor)
git log --oneline a642e27  # upstream's tip (NOT an ancestor — preserved under upstream/)

# Recompile to verify
dotnet build CompoundSpheres.sln
dotnet test Tests/CompoundSpheres.Tests/CompoundSpheres.Tests.csproj
```

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Build (CompoundSpheres.csproj, net48) | 0 errors |
| Tests (CompoundSpheres.Tests, 19 tests) | 19/19 PASS in 641 ms |

## Origin: WorldSphere3D

This repository is a Unity-tool submodule of **WorldSphereMod3D** (WSM3D). The lineage
runs: `SphereManager` → `WorldSphereMod` → `CompoundMeshes/MeshManager` upstream, while
we pin to the WSM3D-extended `CompoundSpheres/` lineage in this fork.

See `upstream/README.upstream.md` for MelvinShwuaner's upstream README, and
`../../docs/upstream-divergence-audit.md` (cross-repo) for the full divergence matrix.
